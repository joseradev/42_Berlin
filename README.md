Warnings:

1. This repository is for personal use only. The code may contain logical errors, and the Norminette parameters may not be fully covered. It is also possible that loops, functions, etc., that are not permitted under The Norm are used.
2. If you are doing a piscine at any 42 school: remember that this is a peer-to-peer learning experience, and before reviewing the repository, make sure to ask your peers as your first option.
3. If you are about to start a piscine at any 42 school: I recommend not look at this repository. Remember that no one knows the criteria they use to accept people into the school, and therefore, any progress you might make in advance could affect your experience in the piscine and your potential admission.
